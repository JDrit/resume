      Engineer}{http://apple.com/}
    \vspace{-5mm}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Designed key aspects of the backing storage engine that enables iCloud to scale to
        hundreds of millions of users each month.
      \item Architected the new multi-tenant storage compaction system which provides better
        throughput guarantees and reliability.
      \item Engineered a proactive solution to data loss prevention. Lead to the discovery of
        several undiscovered, subtle bugs in the underlying frameworks and data store.
      \item Vastly reduced database load by introducing a framework that allows numerous subsystems
        to share the same pooled resources concurrently.
      \item Languages / tools used: Scala, Java, Cassandra, MapReduce.
    \end{itemize}
