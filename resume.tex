      Engineer}{http://apple.com/}
    \vspace{-5mm}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Designed key aspects of the backing blob store engine that enables iCloud to scale to
        hundreds of millions of users each month.
      \item Architected the new multi-tenant compaction system which provides better throughput
        guarantees and reliability.
      \item All of this work provides better resource forcasting for finance teams. 
      \item Engineered a proactive solution to data loss prevention. Lead to the discovery of
        several undiscovered, subtle bugs in the underlying frameworks and data store.
      \item Vastly reduced database load by introducing a framework that allows numerous subsystems
        to share the same pooled resources concurrently.
      \item Languages / tools used: Scala, Java, Cassandra, MapReduce
    \end{itemize}
    \employer{Cloudera}{San Francisco, CA}{Summer 2015}{Software Engineer
